# Matlab_Researching_Gauss_With_Partial_Pivoting
## Description

This MATLAB project focuses on solving a system of linear equations of the form `Cz = c`, where `C` is a complex `n × n` matrix, and `z` and `c` are complex vectors.

The components are defined as:

- `C = A + iB`, where `A` and `B` are real `n × n` matrices.
- `z = x + iy`, where `x` and `y` are real `n × 1` vectors (the unknowns).
- `c = a + ib`, where `a` and `b` are real `n × 1` vectors.

The project implements a solution using **Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting (GEPP)**.
